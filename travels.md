## My favorite travel Experience
When I was in middle school, I was  able to go on a student exchange program to Japan.  I have traveled many places since including the BVI, Europe, Canada, Mexico and all over the US.  However that exchange program made the most impact on me and I remember all the time I spent there fondly.
